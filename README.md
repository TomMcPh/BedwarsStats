As a computer science major, I, like many others enjoy meticulously analysing stats. 
Bedwars is all about EGO, and this GUI has the ability to prove it. 
Up to 300 requests per 5 minutes, check anyone in the Hypixel Lobby or ingame. 

To setup.
1. Ensure have rust installed.
2. Get an API key from the
https://developer.hypixel.net/dashboard 
4. Download the files
5. Run **cargo run** in the Cargo.toml root which will build and run the GUI.
6. Enjoy the GUI.
